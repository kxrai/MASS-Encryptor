                <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
                <p>The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Commonly used for educational purposes to introduce encryption concepts.</p>
                <p><strong>Encoding Example:</strong> With a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.</p>

                <h2>Keyword Cipher</h2>
                <p>The Keyword Cipher uses a keyword to create a substitution alphabet. The keyword's letters are placed at the beginning of the alphabet, and the remaining letters follow in their usual order, excluding any letters already used in the keyword.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Useful for creating a simple yet more secure cipher than the Caesar Cipher.</p>
                <p><strong>Encoding Example:</strong> If the keyword is 'KEY', the substitution alphabet starts with 'KEYABCDFGH...'. 'A' becomes 'K', 'B' becomes 'E', etc.</p>

                <h2>Atbash Cipher</h2>
                <p>The Atbash Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where the alphabet is reversed. 'A' is substituted with 'Z', 'B' with 'Y', and so on.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Historically used in the Hebrew language, it is mainly of interest today for its historical significance.</p>
                <p><strong>Encoding Example:</strong> 'HELLO' becomes 'SVOOL' as 'H' maps to 'S', 'E' to 'V', etc.</p>

                <h2>Morse Code</h2>
                <p>Morse Code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of dots and dashes. Each letter and number is represented by a unique combination of short and long signals.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Widely used in early radio communications and still in use for emergency signals.</p>
                <p><strong>Encoding Example:</strong> 'SOS' is encoded as '... --- ...'.</p>
